I have been super keen to play some Call of Duty again but a little jaded about the latest iterations in the series. 
So I though it would be cool to setup a Call of Duty 4X server to play with friends and family.

Been a bit of a journey to get it up and running but it is now live and ready to play.
Had to rebuild someone's docker image to get it to work on my server but it is now running smoothly.

### COD4X Client
To join you are going to need COD4X Client installed.

Download the client from here (I have scanned it and it is clean)
https://cod4x.ovh/t/releases/24

1. extract the archive and place the folder `cod4-client-manualinstall_21.1` at the root of you Call of Duty 4 installation (Steam: Manage Local Files).
2. Go into `cod4-client-manualinstall_21.1` and run `install.cmd`
3. Start the game
4. It will have a popup, dismiss it and start the game again (once off)

#### Adding Server 

1. Start the game
2. Go to `Join Game`
3. Switch to `Favourites`
4. Click `New Favourite`
5. Enter the IP `165.73.68.163` and click `Add Favourite`
6. Highlight server 
7. Click `Password` (bottom)
8. Enter the password (DM me for it)
9. Click `Join Server`

### Issues
