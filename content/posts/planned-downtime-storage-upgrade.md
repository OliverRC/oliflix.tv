::alert
The server will be taken offline probably Tuesday, April 30th, 2024 for a few hours to upgrade the storage.
::

We will need to take the server offline for a few hours to upgrade the storage. 
Currently at 95% capacity and need to expand the storage to accommodate the growing demands.

The server has 8 drives totalling 40TB usable space, however we are already at 38TB.

We will be adding two drives expanding the storage to 66TB to give us some breathing room.

Hopefully this will satiate our storage needs for the meantime.
